        notice: >
          Changed from a generic replay-implementation to a specific for deterministic applications.
        changes:
          changed:
          - Change `ApplicationVersion` from `SemanticVersion` to a 32 octet payload for greater flexibility.
          - Change icons for RAFF files.
          added:
          - Add `ScanOptions` for `ReplayReader` that enables a replay file to be read, ignoring some minor file corruptions like a missing end chunk.
          docs:
          - Documentation of `ReplayReader` and `ReplayWriter`.

      Authoritative Steps:
        changes:
          changed:
          - rename `AuthoritativeStep` to `AuthoritativeStepForOneParticipant` to make it more clear.
          fixed:
          - now checks if the `SerializeProviderConnectState` is `Normal` before checking the payload.
            Payload is null in all other states.

      Predicted Steps:
        changes:
          changed:
          - Rename `Deserialize` to `Read` in `PredictedStepsReader`
          - Rename `CombinedRangesReader` to `AuthoritativeStepsReader`
          - Rename `CombinedRangesWriter` to `AuthoritativeStepsWriter`
          - Rename `PredictedStepsSerialize` to `PredictedStepsWriter`

          performance:
          - Add AggressiveInlining in `PredictedStepsQueue`

      Discoid (circular buffers):
        changes:
          performance:
          - Add AggressiveInlining for `CircularBuffer` and `DiscoidBuffer`

        changes:
          performance:
          - AggressiveInlining for methods in `OctetReader` and `OctetWriter`
